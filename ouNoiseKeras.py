# We'll use a specific noise process that has some desired properties,
# called the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process.
# It essentially generates random samples from a Gaussian (Normal) distribution,
# but each sample affects the next one such that two consecutive samples are
# more likely to be closer together than further apart.
# In this sense, the process in Markovian in nature.

# Why is this relevant to us? We could just sample from Gaussian distribution,
# couldn't we? Yes, but remember that we want to use this process to add
# some noise to our actions, in order to encourage exploratory behavior.
# And since our actions translate to force and torque being applied to
# a quadcopter, we want consecutive actions to not vary wildly. Otherwise,
# we may not actually get anywhere!
# Imagine flicking a controller up-down, left-right randomly!

# Besides the temporally correlated nature of samples, the other nice thing
# about the OU process is that it tends to settle down close to the specified
# mean over time. When used to generate noise, we can specify a mean of zero,
# and that will have the effect of reducing exploration as we make
# progress on learning the task.
